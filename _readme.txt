PXDrum Portable Drum Machine

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Version 2.0



PXDrum is a simple pattern-based drum sequencer which uses sampled drum sets.



PXDrum is developed to be:


1. Used to quickly "sketch" out drum patterns, anywhere.

2. Useful to musicians.

3. Easy to use.



PXDrum is cross-platform. This means that it is designed 
so that it is easy to make versions of it that will run on Windows or Linux or anything that supports SDL (Simple Directmedia Layer).



See "quickstart.txt" before you use the program.


See "PXDrum 2.0 Manual.pdf" for more detailed information on how to use the program.



PXDrum is customisable. It can use different drum sets ("drumkits") which can 
be customised to your needs, or used to emulate your favourite drum machine. 
The look of PXDrum can be customised through "skins". Keyboard keys and 
controller buttons can be remapped. Please see "customising.txt" for details.



PXDrum is a work-in-progress. It is useable, but some features are incomplete 
or unimplemented, and is probably buggy.
