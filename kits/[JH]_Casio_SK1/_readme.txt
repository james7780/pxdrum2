Samples for this Casio SK1 drumkit were sampled by me (James Higgs)
from my own Casio SK1.

Care has been taken to make sure every drum sound used in the SK1 
rhythms is here.

Please note that "synth drums.wav" is not one of the sounds used in
the SK1 rhythms. It is one of the 8 SK1 instrument souunds, but I 
have included it for completeness, and because it perfectly 
represents the cheesiness of the SK1.
