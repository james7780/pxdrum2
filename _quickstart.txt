PXDrum 2.0 "Quick Start"

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~




When PXDrum has loaded, you have a empty song.



Right-click on the Song name (it should say "<empty>") to bring up the File Menu.



In the File Menu, use the up / down arrow keys to highlight the option "Load Song", then press ENTER. You will be given a list of the songs in the "songs" folder of PXDrum.



Use the up / down arrow keys to highlight the song "groove1.xds", then press ENTER to select it. 

The song will be loaded into PXDrum, and you will be back at the PXDrum main screen.



Press SPACE to start or stop playback of the song.


Press M to change the playback mode from "Pattern" to "Song" to "Live".


Press R to rewind the song or pattern (depending on the playback mode).


Press PgUp or PgDn keys to change the current pattern (You can also use the [ and ] keys).


Click in the "Vol" bar to change main volume.


Click in the BPM bar to change playback speed (you can also "tap" the tempo you want by clicking repeatedly on the "TAP" button).
Press F1 or click on "Help" button to get more help.




You should be able to figure out how most of PXDrum works by left-clicking or right-clicking on objects.
