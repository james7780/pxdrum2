XDrum Overview:

XDrum is a simple (easy to use) drum machine / drum sequencer.

It was designed to be:
1. Portable (ie: useable on handheld devices)
2. Cross-platform (ie: easily ported to run on various hardware).
3. Simple (ie: easy to learn, easy to use)
4. Useful (ie: for use by musos)


Features:
You can create drum patterns that can be arranged into a "song".
You can change "drumkits" to get the specific drum sounds you want.
Up to 8 drum sounds can be played simultaneously.
Drum "songs" can be saved and loaded to disk.
Song, "Pattern" and "Live" playback mode


Advanced Features:
1. Exporting to MIDI / Importing from MIDI
2. Exporting to WAV (pattern / song)
3. Create your own drumkits.
4. Create your own "theme" graphics.
5. Playback Sync (with another PSP?)
	- Use UDP broadcast?
6. Shuffle and randomness

Issues:
1. BIN or TEXT file format?
2. PSP "Mouse" drift / control. (Should be able to use XDrum without mouse/anapad)
3. Use arrow keys for moving in pattern grid (with repeat).
4. Timing (ie: more accurate)
	- next tick array (ie: each column in grid has a "future tick" associated with it)
	- calculated using float math
5. Reference drumkit in Song (by name), or embed it?

[TITLE - PXDrum Portable Drum Machine - V1.2 - Jum Hig]

[STARTUP SEQUENCE]
This is the PXDrum 1.2 demo video. PXDrum is a simple, easy-to-use portable drum machine for 
Sony PSP and other systems.

---

[MAIN SCREEN]
This is the main PXDrum interface, showing the drum pattern grid, the track info area, and 
areas for editing the song sequence and changing volume and beats per minute.

We are going to load a drum song (also called a sequence) from the PSP's memory stick.

We move the cursor over the song name, then We press the "options" button (the circle button on the PSP) to bring up a list of the
song files on the memory stick. The options button is like a right-click button on a PC.
[RIGHT-CLICK ON SONG NAME]

[SONG FILE LIST]
You will see a list of the songs on the memory stick. Select a song file and click X button.

[MAIN SCREEN]
The song is loaded and is playing.

---

We can stop and start playback with the START button.
[PRESS START BUTTON TO STOP PLAYBACK]
Playback stopped.
[PRESS START BUTTON TO START PLAYBACK]
Playback started again.

We can rewind the song or the current pattern with the SQUARE button.
[PRESS SQUARE BUTTON]

We can set the playback mode using the SELECT button.
[PRESS SELECT BUTTON]
Note how playback mode cycles between the PAttern mode, Song mode and Live mode.
[PRESS SELECT BUTTON A FEW TIMES]

So to play the song sequence from the beginning, we press STOP, then change playback mode to song, 
then press REWIND, then press START.
[PRESS START, SELECT to SONG, SQUARE, THEN START AGAIN]

---

If we don't like the current drumkit, we can load a different one by moving the cursor over the 
drumkit name, then pressing the options button.
[PRESS OPTION BUTTON WHILE OVER DRUMKIT NAME]

This brings up a list of the drumkits on the memory stick. We are going to choose a cheesy
CASIO SK-1 drumkit.
[SELECT THE SK-1 DRUMKIT]

Now the song is playing with the new drumkit. You use whichver drumkit you prefer, or even make your own.

---

We can drop tracks into and out of the mix by using the track mute and solo.
To mute a track, click on the mute button for that track.
[PRESS MUTE ON HIHAT TRACK]

Or we can solo a track by clicking on it's solo button.
[PRESS SOLO ON BASSDRUM TRACK]

We can also set the mix volume per track.
[UNSOLO, THEN SET HIHAT to 50% VOL]

That's PXDrum in a nutshell.
