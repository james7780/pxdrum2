Customsing Drumkits:

    - Default drumkit is the one that appears when you start up PXDrum.
    - Setting default drumkit:
        - Delete all files from "kits/default"
        - Copy the drumkit files from drumkit you want as the default, into "kits/default" folder.
        - eg: To make Alesis HR16A your default drumkit, copy all the files from 
              "kits/[KB6]_Alesis_HR16A" folder into "kits/default folder".

    - Creating a new drumkit:
        - Make a new folder for the drumkit in the "kits" folder.
        - Copy WAV sample files for the drumkit into the new drumkit folder.
        - Copy "kit.cfg" file from another drumkit into the new drumkit folder.
        - Edit the new "kit.cfg" file:
                - On first line, change the name to your drumkit's name
                - On the second line, change the author to your name
                - On the track<n>= lines, associate your drum samples to a track
                - Save your new kit.cfg
                - Run PXDrum, and load your new drumkit
                - If there are arrors, then look at the "loadkit.log" file in the pxdrum folder.


Customising Graphics:

    - Skins are in the "gfx/skins" folder
    - Skin "default" must not be modified
    - To set a skin as the default:
        - Copy bitmaps from the skin's folder to the "gfx" folder
        - Overwrite if prompted
    - texture.bmp also sets the "background", "border", "separator" and "highlight" colours for the gui
