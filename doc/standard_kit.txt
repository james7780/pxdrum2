XDrum Standard Kit
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All the drumkits supplied with XDrum have the same standard setup, so that if you decide to load a different drumkit to use with a song you have created, the drumkit sounds will not be mixed up.

Since XDrum can handle only 8 drum sounds, the standard drumkit sounds are the most commonly used drum sounds in pop/rock.

Track 1: Kick drum (bass drum)
Track 2: Snare drum
Track 3: Closed Hi-Hat
Track 4: Open Hi-Hat
Track 5: Clap
Track 6: Tom 
Track 7: Cowbell
Track 8: Cabasa / Shaker

It is of course possible to create your own drumkit that does not follow this standard. Just bear in mind that if you create a song using a non-standard drum sound mapping, it will not sound correct when played back using a standard drumkit.
